### Vungle Unity Plugin Requirements
* Supports Unity 2017 and higher

### Running the Vungle sample app
To run our sample app, download our Unity Sample app. Create a new project in Unity. With Unity open and your project presented, double-click the included VungleSDK.unitypackage file to add the Vungle Unity Plugin to your application.

Click All to select everything before importing.

In Project window, navigate to the Assets Folder, check to see if this folder has all the files in your downloaded project Assets folder. If all these files are not in your Unity Assets folder then move them manually by right clicking on Assets folder in Unity and choose "open in finder", in the opened finder window copy and paste everything from the downloaded Sample app assets folder to your Unity project's Asset folder and replace the files if necessary.

In Unity, project navigator->Assets doubleclick on MainTitleScreen.

Click on GameObject, choose TitleGUI inside Inspector->Title GUI (Script). If the link is broken re-add the Title GUI script back to the GameObject. Attach the corresponding UI elements to the script if the links are broken.

Press Command + Shift + B to open up Build Settings. Click on iOS, Android or Windows then hit Switch Platform.

In the Build Settings window click on Player Settings. In Inspector, make sure Company Name, Product Name, Package Name are your own and correct values.
